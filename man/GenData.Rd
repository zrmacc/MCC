standard normal distribution.}

\item{death_rate}{Arrival rate for the terminal event.}

\item{frailty_variance}{Variance of the gamma frailty.}

\item{min_event_rate}{Minimum subject-specific event rate. Must be positive.}

\item{n0}{Subjects in the reference arm.}

\item{n1}{Subjects in the treatment arm.}

\item{tau}{Truncation time.}
}
\value{
Data.frame, containing:
\itemize{
  \item Subject 'idx', treatment 'arm', a baseline covariate 'covar', 
    an indicator 'strata' of stratum membership.
 \item 
 \item 'time' and 'status' of the event: 0 for censoring, 1 for an 
    event, 2 for death.
}
}
\description{
Simulate recurrent events data using exponential censoring, gap, and death 
times. Status is coded as 0 for censoring, 1 for event, 2 for death. 
\itemize{
  \item The subject-specific event rate may depend on the treatment arm,
  a single standard normal covariate, and a binary stratification factor.
  \item The subject-specific event rate is calculated as base_event_rate *
  exp(arm x treatment_effect + covar x covar_effect + strata x strata_effect).
