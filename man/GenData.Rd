\item{n0}{Subjects in the reference arm.}

\item{censoring_rate}{Arrival rate for the censoring time.}

\item{base_event_rate}{Baseline arrival rate for recurrent events.}

\item{death_rate}{Arrival rate for the terminal event.}

\item{treatment_effect}{Log rate ratio for treatment.}

\item{pi}{Probability of membership to the high-risk stratum.}

\item{risk_effect}{Log rate ratio for membership to the high risk stratum.}

\item{covar_effect}{Log rate ratio for the covariate, which follows a 
standard normal distribution.}

\value{
Data.frame, containing:
\itemize{
  \item Subject 'idx', treatment 'arm', a baseline covariate 'covar', 
    an indicator 'strata' of membership to the high-risk stratum, and the
    subject's true underlying event rate.
  \item 'time' and 'status' of the event: 0 for censoring, 1 for an 
    event, 2 for death.
}
}
\description{
Simulate recurrent events data using exponential censoring, gap, and death 
times. Status is coded as 0 for censoring, 1 for event, 2 for death.
