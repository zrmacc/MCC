Note that subjects who are neither censored nor die are assumed to
remain at risk throughout the observation period.}

\item{arm}{Arm, coded as 1 for treatment, 0 for reference.}

\item{covars}{Optional covariate matrix. Rows should correspond with the
subject index `idx`. Factor and interaction terms should be expanded.}

\item{strata}{Optional stratification factor.}

\item{cens_after_last}{Should subjects who lack an explicit censoring time
be censored after their last observed event?}
