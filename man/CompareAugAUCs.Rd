\usage{
CompareAugAUCs(
  time,
  status,
  arm,
  idx,
  tau,
  covars = NULL,
  alpha = 0.05,
  boot = FALSE,
  perm = FALSE,
  reps = 2000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Observation time.}

\item{status}{Status, coded as 0 for censoring, 1 for event, 2 for death.
Note that subjects who are neither censored nor die are assumed to remain
at risk throughout the observation period.}

\item{arm}{Arm, coded as 1 for treatment, 0 for reference.}

\item{idx}{Unique subject index.}

\item{tau}{Truncation time.}

\item{covars}{Optional covariate matrix. Rows should correspond with the
subject index `idx`. Factor and interaction terms should be expanded.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha level.}

\item{boot}{Logical, construct bootstrap confidence intervals?}

\item{perm}{Logical, perform permutation test?}

\item{reps}{Replicates for bootstrap/permutation inference.}
}
\value{
Object of class CompareAugAUCs with these slots:
\itemize{
  \item `@Areas`: Marginal AUC for each arm.
  \item `@CIs`: Observed difference and ratio in areas with confidence intervals.
  \item `@MCF`: Mean cumulative count curve for each arm.
  \item `@Pvals`: Bootstrap and permutation p-values.
  \item `@Reps`: Bootstrap and permutation realizations of the test statistics.
}
}
\description{
Confidence intervals and p-values for the difference and ratio of areas under
the mean cumulative count curves, comparing treatment (arm = 1) with
reference (arm = 0) with adjusted for covariates.
